# Bureaucratisation of Art

From the moment when this organisation leaves the initial experimental stage for its first public campaign, the most urgent objective we have ascribed to it is the seizure of U.N.E.S.C.O. United at a world level, the **[[bureaucratisation of art]] and all culture** is a new phenomenon which expresses the deep inter-relationship of the social systems co-existing in the world on the basis of eclectic conservation and the [[reproduction of the past]]. The riposte of the revolutionary artists to these new conditions must be a **new type of action**. As the very existence of this managerial concentration of culture, located in a single building, favours a seizure by way of putsch; and as the institution is completely destitute of any sensible usage outside our subversive perspective, we find our seizure of this apparatus justified before our contemporaries. And we will have it. We are resolved to take over U.N.E.S.C.O., even if only for a short time, as we are sure we would quickly carry out work which would prove most significant in the clarification of a long [[series of demands]].

Against particularised art, it will be a **[[global practice]]** with a bearing, each moment, on all the usable elements. Naturally this would tend to collective production which would be without doubt **anonymous** (at least to the extent where the works are no longer stocked as commodities, *this culture will not be dominated by the need to leave traces.*) The minimum proposals of these experiences will be a revolution in behaviour and a dynamic unitary urbanism capable of extension to the entire planet, and of being further extensible to all habitable planets.


Against unilateral art, situationist culture will be an **[[art of dialogue]]**, an art of [[interaction]]. Today artists - with all culture visible - *have become entirely separated from society*, just as they are separated from each other by **competition**. But faced with this impasse of **[[capitalism]]**, art has remained essentially unilateral in response. This enclosed era of primitivism must be superseded by [[complete communication]].
