Q:
### !(Only humans?)
### !(leave no traces, is it possible and is it correct?)



The existing framework cannot subdue the new human force that is increasing day by day alongside the irresistible development of technology and the dissatisfaction of its possible uses in our senseless social life.

  **[[Alienation and oppression]]** in this [[society]] cannot be distributed amongst a range of variants, but only **rejected** en bloc with this very society. All real progress has clearly been suspended until the revolutionary solution of the present multiform crisis.

## Total Automation, Homo Ludens concept, new surpluse value
The guarantee of the liberty of each and of all is in the value of the **[[game]]**, of life freely constructed.


## Game as revolution 

So what really is the [[situation]]?


## Self-management 

Henceforth, we propose an autonomous organisation of the producers of the new culture, independent of the political and union organisations which currently exist, as we dispute their capacity to organise anything other than the management of that which already exists.

## Presentism, "new" meaning, demands!

the **[[bureaucratisation of art]] and all culture** 

What would be the principle characteristics of the new culture and how would it compare with ancient art?

[[Against the spectacle]], the realised situationist culture introduces **[[total participation]]**.

## [[future]]

At a higher stage, **everyone will become an artist**,
